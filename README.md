# UdaciCards

This is the project for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Native course where I've build a mobile app for flashcard memorization. Users will be able to create new decks, create cards with questions and answers for those decks and do a quiz based on that questions. Also, the user will receive a notification for days that didn't do a quiz
